# Robots in MORSE using ROS
Robots simulated in MORSE that can be controlled using ROS

The repository is composed by:
* __robots__: several robots defined as ROS packages that include MORSE simulation files.
* __morse_tools__: helpers and tools for MORSE simulator that are used by the robots. 
* __ros_tools__: helpers and tools for ROS to be used by the robots.

This code is being used on ROS [Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo) and MORSE [v1.4](https://github.com/morse-simulator/morse/blob/1.4_STABLE/README.md).
